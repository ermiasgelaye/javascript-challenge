# Are Actually Aliens on Earth?
## JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

This respository displayed the eye-witness reports, and the collected data that shows the extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth, and the `ALIENS-R-REAL`. All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.

A Dynamic javascript and DOM manipulation was created to integrates various javascript [libraries provide](StarterCode/static/js/data.js) from D3 to Moments and pulls in data from a filtered javascript object to populate a table. Users can also filter the table data for specific values. I used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js to deploy the data on the web page.

### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search (Required)
* A basic HTML web page was created [index.html](StarterCode/index.html).
* All the UFO dataset JavaScript objects were appended to a table in to the web page, and then a new rows added for each UFO sighting.
* Finally `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment` columns was created. 
* On this part we displayed a form with a filtering option that uses the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories (Optional)
* Level two satisfies all the criterias of Level 1, but it added a multiple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns, so that the users can set a multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
